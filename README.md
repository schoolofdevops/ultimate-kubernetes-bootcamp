## Objectives

This course follows a hands on  workshop method and builds container orchestration skills  on top of existing skills learnt in Docker Fundamentals. Participants learn how to built a production grade resilient, self healing infrastructure  with kubernetes. They take the container images built earlier and deploy with the high availability, fault tolerance, scalability provided by kubernetes.

## Flipped Classroom Methodology

This course follows a [Flipped Classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) methodology, a blended model where participants come prepared with understanding of concepts by going through video/online content. The class time is maximized to perform practical activities to apply the concepts learnt earlier. Practice activities include taking up a use case and solving it by applying the techniques, or performing nano projects etc.   

To make it successful, participants need to be prepared in advance, by going through  the recommended pre class content to clear the concepts as well as by making sure their systems are prepared with all the software required, before the class. The pre class checklist given below can be handy for this purpose.

## Who is this for ?

  * This course is for someone who has already taken docker fundamentals course/has equivalent knowledge, and would like to learn how to extend it to **orchestrate container** deployments at production scale with kubernetes.
  * If you are a **Operations/Systems** personnel and would like to learn how scalable, fault tolerant and high available infrastructures are built on or off cloud to orchestrate container based deployments, this course it for you.
  * If you are a **developer** and would like to learn how to deploy your application stacks in production, on top of scalable, highly available  and leverage features provided by kubernetes, this course is for you.
  * If you are a **QA**, and if your organization has a staging/QA environment built on kubernetes, and you would like to understand how to leverage it for setting up automated test workflow and learn the primitives offered by kubernetes, this course is for you.
  * You could be developer/operations personnel and be in charge of securing application infrastructure and setup auxiliary services such as  monitoring, centralized  logging etc. this course is for you.

## Who is this not for ?

  * If you are a **advanced user of Kubernetes** already, this course is definitely not for you.
  * If you are looking to start with Kubernetes concepts, this course is not for you as it assumes basic understanding of Kubernetes and COEs. There is a free resource **Kubernetes Quick Dive** which you should go through before attending this workshop.  
  * If you are interested in learning docker/container orchestration on **windows**, this course is not ideal for you as it focuses on linux containers.
  * If you expect to learn a technology which is mainly driven through a **GUI**, this course is not suitable for you. Using kubernetes requires you to write YAML specifications, use command line tools etc.  


## What will you do as part of this course ?

As part of this course you will,  

   * Design a **scalable, resilient, secure** solution for deploying microservices application stack in production using primitives offered by kubernetes.
   * Install and configure a simple(non HA) multi node kubernetes cluster  with **kubeadm**. You would also have a conceptual understanding of  how to build a production quality cluster with high availability, scalability,  redundancy and  security considerations.
   * Learn how applications from a micro services stack interconnect with **services** as well as expose public facing services with various options including nodeport, externalIP, ingress etc.
   * Achieve  **Continuous Deployment** with different release strategies  such as **Zero Downtime, Blue/Green, Canary** etc.  
   * Learn how to manage **persistent storage** in a kubernetes environment
   * Learn about the network primitives including **CNI** plugins, service networking and iptables, ingress etc.
   * Deploy an application which is auto scalable, high available, and resilient to failures.

## What is not covered ?

Even though this course covers many concepts related to kubernetes, since its a very vast topic, it still has the following areas uncovered.

  * Advanced RBAC
  * Cloud specific provisioning and integration
  * HA deployment of a kubernetes cluster with multi masters
  * In depth kubernetes administration
  * Writing Micro Services Applications
  * Alternate container runtimes e.g. rocker/rkt, runc
