# Kubernetes Horizonntal Pod Autoscaling

With Horizontal Pod Autoscaling, Kubernetes automatically scales the number of pods in a replication controller, deployment or replica set based on observed CPU utilization (or, with alpha support, on some other, application-provided metrics).

The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is implemented as a Kubernetes API resource and a controller. The resource determines the behavior of the controller. The controller periodically adjusts the number of replicas in a replication controller or deployment to match the observed average CPU utilization to the target specified by user

### Prerequisites

  * [Metrics Server](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server). This needs to be setup if you are using kubeadm etc.  and replaces **heapster** starting with kubernetes version  1.8.
  * Resource Requests and Limits. Defining [CPU](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-resource/#specify-a-cpu-request-and-a-cpu-limit)as well as [Memory](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/) requirements for containers in Pod Spec is a must

#### Deploying Metrics Server

Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler along with `kubectl top` command depends on the core monitoring data such as cpu and memory utilization which is scraped and provided by kubelet, which comes with in built cadvisor component.  Earlier, you would have to install a additional component called **heapster** in order to collect this data and feed it to the **hpa** controller. With 1.8 version of Kubernetes, this behavior is changed, and now **metrics-server** would provide this data. Metric server  is being included as a essential component for kubernetes cluster, and being incroporated into kubernetes to be included out of box. It stores the core monitoring information using in-memory data store.

If you try to pull monitoring information using the following commands
```
kubectl top pod

kubectl top node
```

it does not show it, rather gives you a error message similar to

[output]
```
Error from server (NotFound): the server could not find the requested resource (get services http:heapster:)
```

Even though the error mentions heapster, its replaced with metrics server by default now.

Deploy  metric server with the following commands,

```
git clone  https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server.git
kubectl apply -f kubectl create -f metrics-server/deploy/1.8+/
```

Validate
```
kubectl get deploy,pods -n kube-system --selector='k8s-app=metrics-server'
```

[sample output]
```
NAME                                   DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.extensions/metrics-server   1         1         1            1           28m

NAME                                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/metrics-server-6fbfb84cdd-74jww   1/1       Running   0          28m
```

Monitoring has been setup.

##### Fixing issues with Metrics deployment 

There is a known issue as off Dec 2018 with Metrics Server where is fails to work event after deploying it using above commands. This can be fixed with a patch using steps below. 


To apply a patch to metrics server, 

```
wget -c https://gist.githubusercontent.com/initcron/1a2bd25353e1faa22a0ad41ad1c01b62/raw/008e23f9fbf4d7e2cf79df1dd008de2f1db62a10/k8s-metrics-server.patch.yaml

kubectl patch deploy metrics-server -p "$(cat k8s-metrics-server.patch.yaml)" -n kube-system
```

Now validate with

```
kubectl top node 
kubectl top pod 
```

where expected output shoudl be similar to, 

```
# kubectl top node
NAME     CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
vis-01   145m         7%     2215Mi          57%
vis-13   36m          1%     1001Mi          26%
vis-14   71m          3%     1047Mi          27%
```
### Defining Resource Requests and Limits

`file: vote-deploy.yaml`


```
....
spec:
containers:
- name: app
  image: schoolofdevops/vote:v4
  ports:
    - containerPort: 80
      protocol: TCP
  envFrom:
  - configMapRef:
      name: vote
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: "200m"
      memory: "250Mi"
    requests:
      cpu: "100m"
      memory: "50Mi"

```

And apply

```
kubectl apply -f vote-deploy.yaml
```

**Exercise:**

  * Define the value of **cpu.request** > **cpu.limit** Try to apply and observe.
  * Define the values for **memory.request** and **memory.limit** higher than the total system memory. Apply and observe the deployment and pods.  



### Create a HPA

To demonstrate Horizontal Pod Autoscaler we will use a custom docker image based on the php-apache image

`file: vote-hpa.yaml`


```
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: vote
spec:
  minReplicas: 4
  maxReplicas: 15
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 40
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: vote
```

apply

```
kubectl apply -f vote-hpa.yaml
```

Validate

```
kubectl get hpa

kubectl describe hpa vote

kubectl get pod,deploy


```



###  Load Test 

`file: loadtest-job.yaml`

```
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: loadtest
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: siege
        image: schoolofdevops/loadtest:v1
        command: ["siege",  "--concurrent=5", "--benchmark", "--time=10m", "http://vote"]
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4
```

And launch the loadtest

```
kubectl apply -f loadtest-job.yaml
```

To monitor while the load test is running ,
```
watch kubectl top pods

```


To get information about the job

```
kubectl get jobs
kubectl describe  job loadtest

```

To check the load test output

```
kubectl logs  -f loadtest-xxxx
```
[replace **loadtest-xxxx** with the actual pod id.]



[Sample Output]

```
** SIEGE 3.0.8
** Preparing 15 concurrent users for battle.
root@kube-01:~# kubectl logs vote-loadtest-tv6r2 -f
** SIEGE 3.0.8
** Preparing 15 concurrent users for battle.

kubectl get jobs
